Git is a version control system (VCS) which allows us to easily switch between versions of our code. All of the code is stored in a *repository*, whenever we make a change to the code we make a *commit* with the details of the change. You can go back and forth through the commits to get to an older version of the code. You can make a *branch* off the commit tree to not be affected by incoming commits when you work on a new component, when you are finished, you can *merge* it back into the main branch. However you have to be careful for *merge conflicts*, often times, other users commits can interfere with the incoming branch, you must choose which changes to keep and which to throw away.

We use GitHub to host our code. It is important to keep in mind that these are not the same thing. GitHub is the service to store our code while Git is the service that lets us manage versions.
